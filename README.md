## :mortar_board: College / Undergrad
In May 2022, I graduated from Haverford College with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I also minored in Statistics, and in Neuroscience.

## :man_office_worker: Career
In August 2022, I started as a Software Engineer (AMTS) at Salesforce in San Francisco. I interned there previously, in the summer of 2021 and in the summer of 2020.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Current Projects
In the spring semester of 2022, I learned how to analyze EEG data using a popular python package called MNE. I also took a "Software Engineering" course, and for our final project my group built a web app and android app that interfaced with a Mongo database to display, submit, and approve scholarship opportunities. 

One of my current side projects is building websites and other software for a project called the Auction for Afghanistan. More to come soon on that.
