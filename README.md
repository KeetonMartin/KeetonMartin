## :man_office_worker: Career
In August 2022, I started as a Software Engineer (AMTS) at Salesforce in San Francisco. I currently work on the Automation Engine Core team, primarily on Flow, which is an automation product. I interned at Salesforce previously, in the summer of 2021 and in the summer of 2020. I moved to NYC, staying on my same team in October 2023. I was promoted to the MTS level in February 2024.

## :mortar_board: College / Undergrad
In May 2022, I graduated from Haverford College with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science. I also minored in Statistics, and in Neuroscience.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Current Projects
In 2024 I've been working on election modeling for the US General Election, and I've been playing around with writing code for social deduction games and for hosting a guestbook on my apartment's network in NYC.

In 2023 I worked on a Fantasy Football dashboard app that allows you to track all of your players across different fantasy leagues, and also shows insights into the landscape of each league. I also worked on a public transit app that would give you real-time updates on the bus or train at your favorite station.

In the summer of 2022 I started working on a simple web app that could tell them about the cheapest and biggest air carriers on their favorite city-pair flight routes. This web app also recommends a credit card based on that route. The first version of the web app was RouteCards, the newer version is Routerunner.

In the spring of 2022, I helped to build websites and other software for a project called the Auction for Afghanistan.

In the spring semester of 2022, I learned how to analyze EEG data using a popular python package called MNE. I also took a "Software Engineering" course, and for our final project my group built a web app and android app that interfaced with a Mongo database to display, submit, and approve scholarship opportunities.
